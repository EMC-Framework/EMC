The EMC (Easy Minecraft Client) Framework
===================

EMC (Easy Minecraft Client) is a framework for modifying Minecraft code without having to think about
obfuscation as the framework will act as a middle man handling your calls to Minecraft.

Your code -> EMC Wrapper -> Obfuscated Minecraft code.

This framework also allows you to write a mod once, then use it on Minecraft 1.8 and above.
